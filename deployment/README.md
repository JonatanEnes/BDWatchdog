## BDWatchdog deployment on Ubuntu 18.04
These scripts have been tested on **Ubuntu 18.04** and can be used to deploy
a functional environment to implement all of **BDWatchdog's** features,
particularly to:

* Store the **process-bassed** metrics generated by the **MetricsFeeder** 
module. Specifically, the metrics are stored on the _OpenTSDB_ database
which runs on top of a standalone _HBase_ database instance hosted on
a standalone, single-node _HDFS_ deployment.

* Store the timestamping information generated by the **TimestampsSnitch**, which
are persisted on a _MongoDB_.

## Requirements

* Sudo access

## Installation

To start the installation process, you can proceed as follows:

##### 1st, Install Java
If you don't have it already, install java 8 and configure it so that 
the JAVA_HOME variable is resolved system-wise. For example, to install 
OpenJDK 8, you can run the next command:
```
apt update
apt install -y openjdk-8-jdk
``` 
and export the variable in /etc/environment
```
echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre" >> /etc/environment
source /etc/environment
```

##### 2nd, Prepare the installation
In order to prepare the installation, first BDWatchdog has to be downloaded (if
you haven't already):
```
git clone https://github.com/JonatanEnes/BDWatchdog
``` 
and then some variables have to be configured in the **BDWatchdog/deployment/config.sh** file
```
DATA_DIR: The directory where all of the data is going to be stored, thus, it has to be writable
BDWATCHDOG_DIR : The path to the BDWatchdog directory
```

##### 3rd, Begin the installation
The installation process can be started by running the install.sh script

**!Please bear in mind that the installation can take several minutes!**

**!We're deploying several layered databases in here!**
```
cd BDWatchdog/deployment/
bash install.sh
```
This script will do a best-effort to install and configure both the 
timestamping (MongoDB) and metrics (HDFS+HBase+OpenTSDB) necessary programs.

##### 4th, Start the services
Once the installation ends, all of the services should have been installed. 
They should have also been started, but at any rate you can start (if needed) 
and test them one by one.

* Timestamping :
```
cd timestamping
bash start.sh
tmux ls
``` 
On the list it should appear an "EVE" terminal

* Metrics :
```
cd metrics
bash start.sh
tmux ls
```
an "OPENTSDB" terminal should be present.

* Web Interface
You can open a broweser and point it to the instance's public IP, expecting
to see the web interface.
