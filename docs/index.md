The **BDWatchdog** framework has been developed in order to offer deep
**diagnostic capabilities** when it comes to resource usage, over a wide 
arrange of **infrastructure units**, from entire hosts down to **individual 
processes**, supporting in the middle virtual machines or **containers**.
This diagnostic is performed by combining both **resource monitoring**, with the
use of time series, as well as **flame graphs** for profiling. The framework is
also capable of working in real-time. 

In this page all the documentation is presented for the several modules and utilities that compose the framework.

* For a brief summary of this tool you can visit its 
[website](http://bdwatchdog.dec.udc.es/monitoring/index.html).
* In order to see data from real experiments where this tool was used, 
you can visit [this demo](http://bdwatchdog.dec.udc.es/TimeseriesViewer_DEMO/).
* For the uncommented source code you can visit its 
[GitHub](https://github.com/JonatanEnes/BDWatchdog).

BDWatchdog has been the subject of a publication in Future Generation Computer 
Systems (FGCS), which is available 
[online](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17316096).
All the technical details are explaine on the full-length paper along with some
experimentation.


In this documentation webpage a simpler approach of the framework's 
architecture is given, in addition to some guidelines for its deployment.
The documentation webpage has been structured with the following sections:

1. [Use case](use_case.md): This sections summarizes the core use case of this framework with a simple example.

2. [Architecture](architecture.md): Which briefly describes the architecture and design used.

3. [Deployment](deployment.md): In this section it is described how to deploy the framework overall. Some guidelines are also provided.

4. [Source Code](code/index.html): If you are interested on the low-level code and code documentation. 

5. [Sponsors](sponsors.md): Some comments on the backers and sponsors of this framework.
