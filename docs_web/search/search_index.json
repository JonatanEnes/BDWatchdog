This diagnostic is performed by combining both resource monitoring , with the use of time series, as well as flame graphs for profiling. The framework is also capable of working in real-time. In this page all the documentation is presented for the several modules and utilities that compose the framework. For a brief summary of this tool you can visit its website . In order to see data from real experiments where this tool was used, you can visit this demo . For the uncommented source code you can visit its GitHub . BDWatchdog has been the subject of a publication in Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS), which is available online . All the technical details are explaine on the full-length paper along with some experimentation. In this documentation webpage a simpler approach of the framework's architecture is given, in addition to some guidelines for its deployment. The documentation webpage has been structured with the following sections: Sponsors : Some comments on the backers and sponsors of this framework. Source Code : If you are interested on the low-level code and code documentation.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"architecture/","text":"","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"deployment/","text":"","title":"Deployment"},{"location":"sponsors/","text":"Sponsors The BDWatchdog framework has been developed as part of a PhD thesis from the candidate Jonatan Enes .
